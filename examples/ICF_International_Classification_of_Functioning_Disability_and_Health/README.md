# International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICDO)

**Project page of the ontology:** https://github.com/icdo/ICF

**Short summary of the ICF:**

> *The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, known more commonly as **ICF**, is a classification of health and health-related domains. These domains are classified from body, individual and societal perspectives by means of two lists: a list of body functions and structure, and a list of domains of activity and participation. Since an individual's functioning and disability occurs in a context, the ICF also includes a list of environmental factors.* - (Source: https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ICF/?p=summary)

## What is an ontology?

### First attempt (a bit less theoretical)

The definition of an ontology is usually very theoretical and requires knowledge in Formal Ontologies, Logics and related fields to fully understand it.
In the following, however, a different definition will be used for a (hopefully) better understanding.

> An ontology of a given domain of interest is a text document that provides
> 1. a vocabulary (= terminology, aka list of terms) for describing the domain of interest,
> 2. annotations (e.g. a definition for a given term) that documents the vocabulary, and
> 3. a logical theory (consisting of definitions, etc.) for the vocabulary, in a way that these three elements together enable a competent user of the ontology to ascertain its intended interpretation.

Definition is an adapted version of the one used in "What is an Ontology?" by Fabian Neuhaus (Source: `NEUHAUS, Fabian. What is an Ontology?. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.09171, 2018.`, [PDF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09171)).

### Second attempt (less theoretical, more common sense)

In other words, an ontology is a clearly defined set of technical terms that are linked to each other (e.g. synonyms, broader and narrower terms) and for which further metadata is available (e.g. definitions, hierarchies). A kind of set of rules (logical theory: axioms, etc.) is used to classify these technical terms so that the modeled technical knowledge can be applied.
